> ***v2.5.44 — Tost order issue Fix***

### ⌛ Changed

- Updated toast ordering so that newly created toasts appear at the top of the list.
- Adjusted toast state logic to keep a maximum of 10 toasts while correctly removing the oldest ones.

> ***v2.5.43 — Animation & Docusaurus Production Fix***

### ✨ Improvements
- Fixed toast enter animations not playing in production builds (Docusaurus / SSR).
- Animation lifecycle is now state-driven (`enter` → `exit`) instead of timing hacks.
- CSS animations are now reliable across dev and production.
- Improve transition effects.

### 🛠 Internal
- Removed `requestAnimationFrame` animation workaround.
- Exit logic is now idempotent, preventing multiple remove calls.
- Pointer events are disabled during exit animation.

### 🧹 Removed
- Removed animation side-effects previously required to force reflow.

### ♿ Accessibility
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
